# 💊 Executive Summary – Pharmaceutical Sales Analysis (2016)
Project created as part of the "ChatGPT for Power BI Users (EDNA)" course
Designed by: Crystal Andrea Dsouza

## Overview
This project presents an in-depth analysis of global pharmaceutical sales data for 2016, focusing on regional trends, therapeutic areas, and sales performance. The interactive Power BI dashboard provides a clear executive summary with metrics such as total revenue, total sales quantity, transaction count, and company coverage.

Through visual storytelling, the report highlights how pharmaceutical performance varied across continents, medical uses, and sales assignments, giving stakeholders a quick yet insightful snapshot of business performance during the year.

## Objectives
The main goal of this project was to:
- Develop a clean and interactive Power BI executive summary dashboard.
- Practice data modeling, transformation, and DAX in a structured analytics workflow.
- Explore how ChatGPT can act as a data copilot to guide analysis, structure data, and improve dashboard design.
- Apply AI-assisted insights to enhance report storytelling and decision-making.

## Learning Journey with ChatGPT
Throughout this course, I worked closely with ChatGPT to guide the analytical and technical process behind this project. Together, we explored:

### Data Preparation
- Cleaned and optimized raw transactional data in Power Query.
- Used custom M code to enrich data (for example, assigning continents based on countries).
- Applied transformation best practices like removing nulls, fixing date types, and standardizing categories.

### Data Modeling
- Designed a star schema structure with a central FactSales table linked to DimDate, DimProduct, DimCustomer, and DimRegion tables.
- Created logical relationships to support flexible slicing by region, time, and medical use.
- Discussed normalization techniques and how to manage lookup dimensions efficiently in Power BI.

### Analysis and DAX
- Calculated key KPIs such as Total Revenue, Total Sales Quantity, Total Transactions, and Unique Companies.
- Explored advanced analysis ideas like revenue contribution by medical use, commission patterns, and regional segmentation.
- Discussed how AI could suggest additional metrics (for example, revenue growth trends or profitability ratios).

### Visualization and Storytelling
- Designed a balanced executive dashboard combining cards, bar charts, a map, and a timeline view.
- Used ChatGPT to refine text summaries and narrative insights, for example, highlighting that Neuropathic Pain accounted for over 50 percent of transactions and that Asia was the top revenue contributor.
- Focused on a clean, minimal theme to emphasize interpretability over visual clutter.

## Key Insights
- Neuropathic Pain was the dominant medical use, representing about 52 percent of total transactions.
- Asia generated the majority of global pharmaceutical revenue, far surpassing other regions.
- The company’s sales were highly concentrated within metabolic and pain-related therapeutic areas.
- Roughly two-thirds of sales were not assigned to external agents, highlighting opportunities for channel optimization.

## Reflection
This course was a deep dive into how ChatGPT can enhance the Power BI development process, from idea generation and data modeling to storytelling and refinement. I learned to use ChatGPT as a thinking partner, not just for technical queries, but also for creative decisions like how to structure visuals and interpret results.

It was interesting to see how AI could guide me through DAX logic, Power Query transformations, and modeling best practices, helping me think like a more experienced data professional while still keeping the learning process approachable and interactive.

## Final Thoughts
The ChatGPT for Power BI Users course truly demonstrated how human and AI collaboration can accelerate analytics. This dashboard is a reflection of that partnership, blending analytical design, data-driven storytelling, and the supportive guidance of AI into one cohesive outcome.
